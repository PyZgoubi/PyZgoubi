Python Zgoubi
By Sam Tygier Sam.Tygier@hep.manchester.ac.uk

This is an interface to zgoubi. It is tested with zgoubi 5.0.0 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/zgoubi/ on Linux.

Requirements
Python 2.5 (2.6 should work, but not tested)
Numpy 1.0 (newer versions should work, but not tested)

To install run
./install.py
and answer the questions

The installer will put the file in the location of your choice. If you choose it will add a line to your .bashrc file to set up the environment. This creates and alias 'pyzgoubi' with which you can run the interface. eg:

pyzgoubi emma

To update an existing installation use
./install update
