Several bug fixes

Note: binary fai reading does not yet work with Zgoubi 5.1 (the format changed since 5.0)



Changes 2.2 -> 2.3
* Reading of binary fai files, use get_all(file='bfai')
* Twiss profile function from David
* Disable sorting by D in OBJET2, can be enabled with .sorted=True
	Makes it easier to keep track of which particle is which, but sorting is needed to group particles by energy, which is what zgoubi asks for. 
* Increase precision of floats in .dat file.
* Move the res(), res_fh(), save_res() etc functions to RESULTS object
* silence option to Line.run() to redirected zgoubi output to files
* Results.get_all() on FAI file gives -1 for X.
* Fix install update on Ubuntu

Changes 2.1 -> 2.2
* Fix reading plt with get_all()

Changes 2.0 -> 2.1
* Improve error message when writing defs
* Fix Line.full_tracking()
* Improve messages when run without an input file
